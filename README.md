# flutter_bug

A new Flutter project.
----
### UPDATE: The flutter projects are being put on hold
###### I would like to continue my machine learning learning(teehee). 
###### There are certain deadlines that were shifted around, so python & machine learning have become my main priority. 
#### Don't worry! We'll be back flying with Flutter in _no time_! 
## Thank you for understanding.

This is mainly going to be, trying out new cool stuff with flutter, but eventually I'll make this into an full app. 

You'll be able to check my commits to see what I've been trying out.

If I follow any guides or classes, I'll link them here.


I'll update this readme as often as I can!

I'm walking through how to get started on Flutter's website. There is a tutorial, [here](https://flutter.io/get-started/codelab/), that you can use to build your first flutter app. The best thing is, you don't even need to have experience with dart or mobile development!

Okay. Instead, I'll do mini flutter projects, and link them in this readme(because I have a cool idea for this repo). Also, when I finished the tutorial, there were more _[things to do!](https://flutter.io/get-started/learn-more/)_!
