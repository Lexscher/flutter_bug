# flutter_bug

A new Flutter project.
----

This is mainly going to be, trying out new cool stuff with flutter, but eventually I'll make this into an full app. 

You'll be able to check my commits to see what I've been trying out.

If I follow any guides or classes, I'll link them here.


I'll update this readme as often as I can!

-----

I'm walking through how to get started on Flutter's website. There is a tutorial, [here](https://flutter.io/get-started/codelab/), that you can use to build your first flutter app. The best thing is, you don't even need to have experience with dart or mobile development!

Okay, Instead, I'll do this in a new repository, and I'll link that below(because I have a cool idea for this repo). [Check it out!](https://github.com/Lexscher/startup_namer)


#### Thank you for taking an interest in my code

### Best,
